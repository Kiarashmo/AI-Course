# AI-Course

Welcome to my AI Projects repository! This repository contains all the projects I will be working on as part of my AI course at university. Each project is designed to challenge my skills and expand my knowledge in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

## Projects

The projects in this repository are as follows:

1. Image Recognition
2. Natural Language Processing
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. Generative Adversarial Networks
5. Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects, you will need to have a basic understanding of AI concepts and Python programming. It is also recommended to have knowledge of popular AI libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

Each project has its own directory with a `README.md` file that contains information on the project's objectives, implementation, and results.

## Contributions

If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to create an issue or make a pull request. Your contributions are always welcome!

## Contact

If you have any questions or want to connect, feel free to email me at [your email address]. I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations in the field of AI.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my university and my AI course instructors for providing me with the resources and knowledge needed to complete these projects.
