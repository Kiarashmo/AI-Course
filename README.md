# AI Course Projects

Welcome to my AI Projects repository! This repository contains all the projects I will be working on as part of my AI course at university. Each project is designed to challenge my skills and expand my knowledge in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

## Projects

The projects in this repository are as follows:

1. Investigation of intelligent vehicles and the application of natural language processing, machine vision, and robotics in intelligent vehicles.
2. Summarize the research paper "Lu, Ximing, Sean Welleck, Peter West, Liwei Jiang, Jungo Kasai, Daniel Khashabi, Ronan Le Bras et al. "Neurologic a* esque decoding: Constrained text generation with lookahead heuristics." arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.08726 (2021)".
3. Implementing Monopoly game.
4. Implementation of the Sudoku game using advanced constraint-based and heuristic methods.
5. Analysing Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 dataset with clustering and classification methods.
6. Solve the n-queens problem using the incremental evolutionary algorithm with n values of 8 and 16.
7. Implementing the research paper "Singh, P., Chaudhury, S., & Panigrahi, B. K. (2021). Hybrid MPSO-CNN: Multi-level particle swarm optimized hyperparameters of convolutional neural network. Swarm and Evolutionary Computation, 63, 100863".
